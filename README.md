# hashdeep-compare

utility to compare 2 hashdeep checksum files that are generated against 2 presumably matching directory sources, and finds the differences.

a use case is if you ran hashdeep against a directory at different times, and possibly expect some level of corruption, you can use this to detect changes.

this tool was mostly written by Github Copilot.
